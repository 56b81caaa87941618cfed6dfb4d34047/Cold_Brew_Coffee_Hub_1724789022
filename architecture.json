The AI then presented a series of questions for the user to clarify how the change should be implemented, including options on whether to change \"home\" to \"homer\" site-wide or only in specific sections, and whether the change should affect only visible text or also include hidden elements like meta tags and alt texts. Subsequently, the user also asked for \"not home\" to be changed to \"home,\" to which the AI again confirmed it would proceed with the change. Additionally, the AI provided a checklist of potential features to implement, including adjustments to navigation and header elements, with checkboxes indicating which features were completed and which were still pending. Among the optional features were implementing a sticky header, adding a search bar, and enabling a dark mode toggle.
