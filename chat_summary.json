Subsequently, the user also asked for \"not home\" to be changed to \"home,\" to which the AI again confirmed it would proceed with the change. Additionally, the AI provided a checklist of potential features to implement, including adjustments to navigation and header elements, with checkboxes indicating which features were completed and which were still pending. Among the optional features were implementing a sticky header, adding a search bar, and enabling a dark mode toggle. The user was prompted with further questions about design and functionality issues related to the header, to which they requested assistance in fixing it. The AI responded by asking for more details about the project, indicating its willingness to assist further.",
